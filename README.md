# Password Generator

This application will create a random, secure password based upon user selection criteria. Password length lies between 8 and 128 characters, based upon the user's request. Characters may include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. 

The user will press a button, which then leads to a series a prompts about what the user would like to include in their password. The users' preferences are then validated via alert messages, and the password appears in the main text box.
